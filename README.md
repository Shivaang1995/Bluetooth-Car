# Bluetooth-Car

In this project I am interfacing Bluetooth(HC-05) module with Arduino Nano, L293D Motor Driver. 

Steps:
Uplaod the code to Arduino Nano.
Connect the TX and RX pins of bluetooth module to RX and TX pins of arduino nano respectively.
Connect the +5v and GND pin of module to the Arduino Nano.
Connect the motor inputs to pin 5,3,11 and 10 of nano.
Connect 5v to motor driver to 5v of nano. GND to GND of nano.
Connect 9v/12v to vin and connect battery with Vin at positive and GND to negetive.
Download the Arduino Car App from google play.
Now pair the bluetooth module HC-05 to your phone.
Open app and do the same.  
Now perform the forward, backward , left and right functions and see its working.

Note: While uploading code remove the TX and RX pin from module.
